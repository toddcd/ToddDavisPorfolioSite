        desc: "I have diverse experience from infrastructure and software development roles in start-up and corporate size teams. I came into software development after a career as a network engineer where I managed data centers, hardware, and security infrastructure.\n\r After some retooling, I moved into a role as a Java developer building APIs and ultimately found my way to frontend development. I’m dedicated to the mission of software development and aiding company and customer success.\n\r When I’m not writing code and exploring new technologies, you can find me racking up miles on bicycle or enjoying a flat white at the local cafe."},
